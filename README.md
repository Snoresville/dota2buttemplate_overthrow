# This template is not my original work. All rights goes to Schokokeks for creating the original template.

This template is derived from Schokokek's template, meaning that most of its functionality can be done with this template.

Due to the port, this template may be highly unstable. Please contact Snoresville#2486 via Discord with details of any errors.

The Wiki section is filled with guides on what to do with this addon (if you skipped Moddota/Schokokek's guide on installing an addon in the first place, I'm kinda worried).

Check it out!
